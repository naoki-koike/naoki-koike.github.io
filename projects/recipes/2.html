	<h2>Instructions</h2>
	<ol>
		<li>Mince the onions and pan-fry them.</li>
		<li>Immerse the panko with milk.</li>
		<li>Add all other ingredient in "A" and mix them.</li>
		<li>Make the steak shape and grill them until the steaks 
		are golden brown.</li>
		<li>Mix all the ingredients in "B". Add the steaks into
		the sause and stew them to the inside,
		and you are finished!</li>
	</ol>
	<h2>Tips and Possibble Substitutions</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Since the steak is stewed, it could be better if
		you leave it a day or two than just eating it as soon 
		as you're done.</li>
		<li>For the meat, it is typical to use beef, 
		but you could mix with some pork if like that better.</li>
		<li>Breadcrums can definitely substitute for panko 
		if nowhere is selling them nearby.</li>
	</ul>
