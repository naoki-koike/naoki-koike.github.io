	<h1>Welcome To The Terminal!</h1>
	<p>We will be using the <cite>Terminal</cite> app throughout the whole school year.</p>
	<p>The Terminal lets you <strong>communicate with the Mac operating system</strong> with command lines. Using the Terminal and linking it with a website called <cite>GitHub</cite>, we will create and edit our websites!</p>
	<p>Three command lines that are essential in the Terminal:</p>
	<ul><li><em>ls</em> - lists all the contents in the directory you are in</li>
		<li><em>cd</em> - changes the directory you are in</li>
		<li><em>pwd</em> - shows the pathway you came in the directories of the computer</li></ul>
	<p>There is a game called <a href="https://web.mit.edu/mprat/Public/web/Terminus/Web/main.html">Terminus</a> which is a good tool to get used to these three commands and other commands!</p>
