	<p>We will be using the Terminal app throughout the whole school year.</p>
	<p>The Terminal lets you communicate with the Mac operating system with command lines. Using the Terminal and linking it with a website called GitHub, we will create and edit our websites!</p>
	<p>Three command lines that are essential in the Terminal:</p>
	<ul>ls - lists all the contents in the directory you are in
		cd - changes the directory you are in
		pwd - shows the pathway you came in the directories of the computer</ul>
