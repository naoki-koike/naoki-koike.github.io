	<h1>Welcome To The Terminal!</h1>
	<p>We will be using the <cite>Terminal</cite> app throughout the whole school year.</p>
	<p>The Terminal lets you <strong>communicate with the Mac operating system</strong> with command lines. Using the Terminal and linking it with a website called <cite>GitHub</cite>, we will create and edit our websites!</p>
	<p>Three command lines that are essential in the Terminal:</p>
	<ul><li><em>ls</em> - lists all the contents in the directory you are in</li>
		<li><em>cd</em> - changes the directory you are in</li>
		<li><em>pwd</em> - shows the pathway you came in the computer</li>
	</ul>
	<p>One example of using the three commands:</p>
	<ol><li>In default, you start at the home directory.</li>
		<li>Run the ls command to see the directories you can access from the home directory. An example of the results would look something like this:
			<br>
			<kbd>ls</kbd>
			<br>
			<pre>Applications	Documents	Library		Music		Public
Desktop		Downloads	Movies		Pictures</pre>
		</li>
		<li>Let's go to the Document directory with the cd command:
			<br>
			<kbd>cd Documents</kbd>
		</li>
		<li>And whenever you are lost, use the pwd command to show the path that you used:
			<br>
			<kbd>pwd</kbd>
			<br>
			<samp>/Users/studentID/Documents<samp>
		</li>
	</ol>
	<p>There is a game called <a href="https://web.mit.edu/mprat/Public/web/Terminus/Web/main.html">Terminus</a> which is a good tool to get used to these three commands and other commands!</p>
