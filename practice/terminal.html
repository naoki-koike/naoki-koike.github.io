	<p>We will be using the Terminal app throughout the whole school year.</p>
	<p>The Terminal lets you communicate with the Mac operating system with command lines. Using the Terminal and linking it with a website called GitHub, we will create and edit our websites!</p>
	<p>Three command lines that are essential in the Terminal:</p>
	<ul><li>ls - lists all the contents in the directory you are in</li>
		<li>cd - changes the directory you are in</li>
		<li>pwd - shows the pathway you came in the directories of the computer</li></ul>
	<p>There is a game called terminus<a>https://web.mit.edu/mprat/Public/web/Terminus/Web/main.html</a> which is a good tool to get used to these three commands and other commands!</p>
