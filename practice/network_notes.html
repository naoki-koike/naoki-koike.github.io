	<h1>Notes on the Internet</h1>
	<h2>Vocab</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Protocol - Rules that we set for the internet to send
		information and data efficiently</li>
		<li>Packet - A fraction of the data that is broke into to
		send the information</li>
		<li>Header - Information listed with the data</li>
		<li>Payload - The information sent</li>
		<li>Router - Checkpoints that pass information around</li>
		<li>Routing table - Rules set by routers to choose the
		 best path</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>Reflection</h2>

	<h3>Problems We Had</h3>
	<p>The routers (tables connected with 2 or 3 other tables) were
	given too many packets at once to sort and pass them.</p>
	<h3>Protocols We Came Up With</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Writing the destination on the header.</li>
		<li>Listing how many packets they sent at once.</li>
		<li>Listing the order that the data was sent.</li>
	</ul>
