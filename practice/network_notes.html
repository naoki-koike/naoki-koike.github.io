	<h1>Notes on the Internet</h1>
	<h2>Vocab</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Protocol - Rules that we set for the internet to send
		information and data efficiently</li>
		<li>Packet - A fraction of the data that is broke into to
		send the information</li>
		<li>Header - Information listed with the data</li>
		<li>Payload - The information sent</li>
		<li>Router - Checkpoints that pass information around</li>
		<li>Routing table - Rules set by routers to choose the
		 best path</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>Reflection</h2>

	<h3>Problems We Had</h3>
	<p>First of all, everyone didn't know where our destination was, 
	which created chaos, and some got lost during the chaos. 
	Additionally, the routers 
	(tables connected with 2 or 3 other tables) were
	given too many packets at once to sort and pass them.</p>
	<h3>Protocols We Came Up With</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Asking "Who are you?" and "Who are your neighbors?" 
		to map out at least some parts of the classroom.</li>
		<li>Writing the starting point and the destination
		on the header so routers are informed enough to
		find the best path.</li>
		<li>Listing how many packets it was sent with to tell
		if the person received knows they have all the packets
		they need.</li>
		<li>Listing the order of the data that was sent so the 
		person received can order them properly.</li>
		<li>Not sending all the packets at once, so the routers
		won't have to deal with many packets at once.</li>
	</ul>
